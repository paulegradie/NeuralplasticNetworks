# Manuscript Spine

Purpose: Define the provisional structure of the first manuscript and keep every section tied to explicit evidence rather than thread memory.

## Provisional Framing

Claim: The current manuscript framing is benchmark-specific and internally supported, but not submission-ready without baselines and hardening:

> A synthetic continual compositional route-memory benchmark shows that context-indexed structural plasticity can store incompatible local transition systems without destructive overwriting, while recurrent dynamics are required to convert one-step route memories into multi-step execution.

Evidence: C1-C5 in the central evidence map are supported by Exp8/Exp11/Exp12/Exp13 internal ablation and capacity artifacts.
Caveat: External baselines, statistical hardening, and novelty-source import remain pending; do not present this as solved continual learning or biological theory.

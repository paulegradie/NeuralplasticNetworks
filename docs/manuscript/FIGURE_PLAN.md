# Candidate Main Figures

Purpose: Track candidate figures and panels while preserving a source path and caveat for every claim.

The canonical thread-integrated figure entries are below. The older artifact inventory retained later in this file is a convenience list, not the claim-bearing figure plan.

Selected small aggregate tables also have readable mirrors under `docs/source_data/`. Figure source paths below continue to cite the authoritative `experiments/...` artifacts.

## Figure 1 - Conceptual Architecture and Task

Purpose: Define the continual compositional route-memory benchmark and the model decomposition.
Panels: task worlds with incompatible transitions; one-step route table; world/context index; recurrent multi-step execution; evidence-level legend.

Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`; `docs/threads/experiment13_1_analysis_digest.md`.
Status: C6 promising; C7 promising internally.
Caveat: Seed-level confidence intervals, final figure scripts, and capacity-law fitting remain pending.

## Figure 5 - Consolidation as Stability-Plasticity Bias

Purpose: Reframe consolidation as a retention bias under pressure rather than an essential accuracy mechanism.
Likely experiments: Exp12, Exp13, Exp13.1.
Panels: consolidation pressure margin; old-vs-new retention heatmaps; Exp13.1 constrained-budget consolidation accuracy panel.
Claim supported: C8.
Source materials: `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/consolidation_pressure_summary.csv`; `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/plots/exp12_consolidation_pressure_world_margin.png`; `experiments/experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/validation_report.md`; `experiments/experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/plots/exp13_retention_heatmap_exp13_full_context_separated_memory_budget_0.5.png`; `experiments/experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/plots/exp13_retention_heatmap_exp13_no_consolidation_budget_0.5.png`; `experiments/experiment13_1_publication_hardening/analysis/exp13_1_full_20260506_214756/exp13_1_budget_consolidation.csv`; `experiments/experiment13_1_publication_hardening/analysis/exp13_1_full_20260506_214756/exp13_1_freeze_plasticity.csv`.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment11_export`; `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`; `docs/threads/experiment13_1_analysis_digest.md`.
Status: Preliminary.
Caveat: Exp13.1 did not show an accuracy rescue from consolidation strength; keep as a caveated stability-plasticity bias.

## Figure 6 - Held-Out Composition Boundary

Purpose: Separate composition over stored primitives from unseen primitive-transition inference.
Likely experiments: Exp12 and Exp13; Exp13.1 successor only if holdout splits are reintroduced.
Panels: seen-primitives composition; unseen primitive failure; route-table accuracy split TODO.
Claim supported: C9.
Source materials: `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/heldout_generalization_summary.csv`; `experiments/experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/true_holdout_generalization_summary.csv`; `experiments/experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/plots/exp13_holdout_compositions_from_seen_primitives.png`; `experiments/experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/plots/exp13_holdout_one_step_unseen_primitives.png`; `experiments/experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/plots/exp13_holdout_routes_requiring_unseen_primitives.png`.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`.
Status: Needs metric cleanup.
Caveat: Do not describe as broad abstract rule generalization.

## Figure 7 - Context Corruption Failure Boundary

Purpose: Show adversarial/wrong-world context corruption as the main local failure evidence for context selection.
Likely experiment: Exp13 and Exp13.1.
Panels: adversarial or wrong-world mixture composition; top-1 world accuracy or world margin across mixture level; caveat panel distinguishing diagnostic bleed/dropout noise plots.

Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`; `docs/threads/experiment11_export`; `docs/threads/experiment13_1_analysis_digest.md`.
Status: Promising.
Caveat: Exp13 adversarial corruption and Exp13.1 wrong-world injection are identity/selection tests; Exp13.1 dropout/bleed did not reduce composition accuracy.

## Figure 8 - Continuous / Perceptual Bridge

Purpose: Show that noisy continuous decoding can feed the route-memory mechanism.
Likely experiment: Exp13.
Panels: continuous noise versus decode accuracy; composition accuracy downstream of noisy decoding; caveat that this is not end-to-end perception.

Source materials: `experiments/experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/continuous_frontend_bridge_summary.csv`; `experiments/experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/plots/exp13_continuous_frontend_decode_vs_noise.png`; `experiments/experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/plots/exp13_continuous_frontend_composition_vs_noise.png`.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`.
Status: Preliminary or supplementary.
Caveat: Not a learned perceptual system.

## Figure 9 - Baseline Suite And Claim Refinement

Purpose: Show how symbolic/algorithmic baselines constrain the manuscript claim.
Likely experiment: Exp13.2.
Panels: CIRM versus oracle context-gated lookup; shared no-context failure on seen-route and first-step context probes; endpoint memorizer seen-vs-suffix split; no-recurrence route-table/composition dissociation; optional capacity/replay baseline curves.
Claim supported: C2, C3, C4, C12.
Source materials: `experiments/experiment13_2_baseline_suite/analysis/exp13_2_full_20260507_165813/exp13_2_summary.csv`; `experiments/experiment13_2_baseline_suite/analysis/exp13_2_full_20260507_165813/exp13_2_effect_sizes.csv`; `experiments/experiment13_2_baseline_suite/analysis/exp13_2_full_20260507_165813/exp13_2_baseline_metrics.csv`; `experiments/experiment13_2_baseline_suite/analysis/exp13_2_full_20260507_165813/plots/exp13_2_seen_route_composition_accuracy.png`; `experiments/experiment13_2_baseline_suite/analysis/exp13_2_full_20260507_165813/plots/exp13_2_suffix_generalization_accuracy.png`; `experiments/experiment13_2_baseline_suite/analysis/exp13_2_full_20260507_165813/plots/exp13_2_route_table_accuracy.png`; `experiments/experiment13_2_baseline_suite/analysis/exp13_2_full_20260507_165813/plots/exp13_2_first_step_context_accuracy.png`; `experiments/experiment13_2_baseline_suite/analysis/exp13_2_full_20260507_165813/plots/exp13_2_capacity_pressure.png`; `experiments/experiment13_2_baseline_suite/analysis/exp13_2_full_20260507_165813/plots/exp13_2_sequential_retention.png`.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment13_2_analysis_digest.md`.
Status: Completed symbolic baseline evidence; figure-script decision pending.
Caveat: Do not frame as CIRM outperforming oracle lookup. The context-gated baseline uses supplied oracle context labels; baselines are symbolic/algorithmic rather than full neural comparators.

# Candidate Main Figures

Purpose: Track candidate figures and panels while preserving a source path and caveat for every claim.

The canonical thread-integrated figure entries are below. The older artifact inventory retained later in this file is a convenience list, not the claim-bearing figure plan.

## Figure 1 - Conceptual Architecture and Task

Purpose: Define the continual compositional route-memory benchmark and the model decomposition.
Panels: task worlds with incompatible transitions; one-step route table; world/context index; recurrent multi-step execution; evidence-level legend.
Claim supported: Framing for C1-C4, not a result claim.
Source materials: `experiment11_context_memory/EXPERIMENT_11_CONTEXT_MEMORY.md`; `experiment12_capacity_generalization/README.md`; `experiment13_breaking_point/README.md`.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment11_export`; `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`.
Status: Manuscript framing decision.
Caveat: Conceptual figure must not imply biological completeness or latent-world inference.

## Figure 2 - Core Mechanism / Ablation Decomposition

Purpose: Show that structural plasticity, world context, and recurrence play separable roles.
Likely experiments: Exp11, Exp12, Exp13.
Panels: full model; no structural plasticity; no world context; no recurrence; route-table vs composition dissociation.
Claim supported: C1, C2, C3, C4.
Source materials: `experiment11_context_memory/analysis/exp11/exp11_memory_indices.csv`; `experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/capacity_final_summary.csv`; `experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/plots/exp12_route_table_composition_gap.png`; `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/capacity_pressure_summary.csv`.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment11_export`; `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`.
Status: Strong internal evidence.
Caveat: Internal ablations require external baselines before submission.

## Figure 3 - Capacity Scaling and Continual Retention

Purpose: Show clean-context capacity scaling and sequential retention before pushing the system to failure.
Likely experiment: Exp12.
Panels: world-count scaling; route length / held-out composition; continual retention heatmap; wrong-world activation or world margin.
Claim supported: C2, C5, C9 with caveats.
Source materials: `experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/capacity_final_summary.csv`; `experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/heldout_generalization_summary.csv`; `experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/plots/exp12_capacity_composition_accuracy.png`; `experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/plots/exp12_continual_retention_heatmap_full_model.png`; `experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/plots/exp12_capacity_wrong_world_activation.png`.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`.
Status: Strong but ceiling-limited.
Caveat: Exp12 context-bleed/dropout curves were judged inconclusive; do not use them as strong robustness evidence.

## Figure 4 - Breaking Point Under Finite Structural Capacity

Purpose: Show the observed finite-budget performance degradation curve.
Likely experiment: Exp13.
Panels: global budget curve; local budget curve; route-table/composition divergence; local damage effect on long-route execution.
Claim supported: C6, C7.
Source materials: `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/capacity_pressure_summary.csv`; `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/local_capacity_pressure_summary.csv`; `docs/experiments/exp13_local_vs_global_budget_comparison.md`; `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/plots/exp13_budget_breaking_curve_full_vs_consolidation.png`; `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/plots/exp13_capacity_accuracy_route_len_12.png`.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`.
Status: C6 promising; C7 preliminary.
Caveat: Docs-only local-vs-global comparison exists; formal paired seed-level comparison and capacity-law fitting remain pending.

## Figure 5 - Consolidation as Stability-Plasticity Bias

Purpose: Reframe consolidation as a retention bias under pressure rather than an essential accuracy mechanism.
Likely experiments: Exp12, Exp13, planned Exp13.1.
Panels: consolidation pressure margin; old-vs-new retention heatmaps; TODO dose-response panel.
Claim supported: C8.

Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment11_export`; `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`.
Status: Preliminary.
Caveat: Exp13 validation reports only a small consolidation delta; dose-response is P0 follow-up.

## Figure 6 - Held-Out Composition Boundary

Purpose: Separate composition over stored primitives from unseen primitive-transition inference.

Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`.
Status: Needs metric cleanup.
Caveat: Do not describe as broad abstract rule generalization.

## Figure 7 - Context Corruption Failure Boundary

Purpose: Show adversarial context corruption as the main local failure evidence for context selection.
Likely experiment: Exp13.
Panels: adversarial mixture composition; top-1 world accuracy or world margin across mixture level; caveat panel distinguishing diagnostic Exp11/Exp12 noise plots.

Source materials: `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/context_corruption_summary.csv`; `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/plots/exp13_context_adversarial_mixture_composition.png`; `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/plots/exp13_context_adversarial_mixture_top1_world.png`; `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/plots/exp13_context_adversarial_mixture_world_margin.png`.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`; `docs/threads/experiment11_export`.
Status: Promising.
Caveat: Exp13 adversarial corruption is threshold-like; Exp11/Exp12 context bleed/dropout artifacts are supplementary diagnostics only.

## Figure 8 - Continuous / Perceptual Bridge

Purpose: Show that noisy continuous decoding can feed the route-memory mechanism.
Likely experiment: Exp13.
Panels: continuous noise versus decode accuracy; composition accuracy downstream of noisy decoding; caveat that this is not end-to-end perception.
Claim supported: C11.
Source materials: `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/continuous_frontend_bridge_summary.csv`; `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/plots/exp13_continuous_frontend_decode_vs_noise.png`; `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/plots/exp13_continuous_frontend_composition_vs_noise.png`.

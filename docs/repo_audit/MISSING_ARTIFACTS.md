- Execute or verify manuscript-critical smoke/standard/full commands.

## Thread-Derived Missing Artifacts And Required Reruns

These items were revealed by the imported thread digests. They should be treated as manuscript blockers or caveats, not as completed findings.

| Item | Why missing / needed | Source thread | Current local status | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Exp1-Exp4 thread evidence | `docs/threads/experiment1to4_export.md` is empty. | `docs/threads/experiment1to4_export.md` | No digest evidence to import. | Either re-export the digest or keep Exp1-Exp4 historical/local-only. |
| Exp6 README run-result cleanup | Thread reports `README.md` still says the first Exp6 run is pending while `exp6_report.md` has results. | `docs/threads/experiment6_export.md` | Local report exists: `experiments/experiment6_route_audit_successor/analysis/exp6/exp6_report.md`. | Update Exp6 README in a separate docs cleanup if desired; no experiment rerun required. |
| Exp13.1 lesion audit/rerun | The completed Exp13.1 full run found targeted critical-edge lesions were less damaging than random count-matched lesions. | `docs/threads/experiment13_1_analysis_digest.md` | Exp13.1 run exists at `experiments/experiment13_1_publication_hardening/`, but corrected lesion evidence is not present. | Audit critical-edge selection and matched lesion controls; rerun only if positive lesion evidence is needed. |
| External baseline suite | Thread novelty assessment says baselines are required before journal readiness. | `docs/threads/experiment11_export`; `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md` | `docs/manuscript/BASELINE_REQUIREMENTS.md` exists, but baseline runs are not present. | Implement shared-table, context-gated, replay, isolation, hypernetwork/superposition, and recurrent non-plastic baselines. |
| Seed-level intervals and effect sizes | Threads cite means and validation summaries but not manuscript-grade uncertainty. | `docs/threads/experiment11_export`; `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`; `docs/threads/experiment13_1_analysis_digest.md` | Summary CSVs exist for Exp8-Exp13.1; final CI/effect-size tables are not indexed. | Add statistical summary artifacts before submission. |
| Final reproducible figure scripts | Figure plan cites existing generated plots, but manuscript panels need reproducible source scripts/tables. | `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md` | Plot PNGs exist; final figure scripts are not indexed. | Create manuscript figure scripts and source-data manifests. |
| Novelty assessment source artifact | Thread references `Pasted text.txt` as a novelty assessment artifact. | `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md` | No matching local artifact is indexed. | Add the novelty assessment to `docs/theory/` or record it as thread-derived only. |

# Reproducibility Audit

## Goal

Can a new researcher clone the repo, run key experiments, regenerate metrics, regenerate plots, and reproduce manuscript claims?

## Current Summary

Current status: partially reproducible.

Existing artifacts are present for Exp11, Exp12, Exp13, Exp13.1, Exp13.2, and Exp14. Launchers and validation commands have been documented or inspected, but no long experiment reruns were executed in this documentation cleanup pass. Manuscript-critical experiments still need fresh command verification, runtime/hardware logs, seed-level uncertainty tables, and final figure-regeneration scripts before submission.

Exp13.2 is now treated as imported symbolic/algorithmic baseline evidence. Exp14 is now treated as imported symbolic transition-cue context-selection evidence.

## Environment

Python version: no formal repository-wide Python version is pinned. Python 3.10+ is recommended for current utility scripts. Exp14 reports Python 3.12.10 in its run metadata.

Package installation:

- There is no root-level requirements file.
- Each experiment has its own `requirements.txt` where needed.
- Exp11 requirements: `experiments/experiment11_context_memory/requirements.txt`.
- Exp12 requirements: `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/requirements.txt`.
- Exp13 requirements: `experiments/experiment13_breaking_point/requirements.txt`.
- Exp13.1 requirements: `experiments/experiment13_1_publication_hardening/requirements.txt`.
- Exp14 requirements and launchers are local to `experiments/experiment14_latent_context_inference/`.

GPU expectations:

- Exp11-Exp14 are table-based or NumPy/Pandas/Matplotlib style workloads, not deep-learning GPU workloads.
- Exp13 explicitly documents that it does not require PyTorch, TensorFlow, torchvision, MNIST downloads, or internet access. Source path: `experiments/experiment13_breaking_point/README.md`.
- Exp13.1 documents that it is table-based and CPU-oriented, with no PyTorch or dataset downloads. Source path: `experiments/experiment13_1_publication_hardening/README.md`.
- Exp13.1 full-run manifest records configuration but not explicit device/runtime metadata. Source path: `experiments/experiment13_1_publication_hardening/analysis/exp13_1_full_20260506_214756/run_manifest.json`.
- Exp14 validation reports CPU/device metadata and an explicit CPU-only GPU rationale. Source path: `experiments/experiment14_latent_context_inference/analysis/exp14_full_20260507_210712/validation_report.md`.

## Historical And Supporting Experiments

Exp1-Exp6 remain historical/exploratory. Exp7-Exp10 are supporting mechanism-building experiments. Their entry points and artifacts are indexed in `docs/repo_audit/ARTIFACT_INDEX.csv`, but this cleanup did not execute their commands or promote them to central evidence.

## Artifact Regeneration

Generated artifacts are preserved in the owning experiment directories as historical records. They should not be overwritten to make documentation tidier.

Final paper figures should eventually be regenerated from scripts with fixed input paths and documented source-data tables. Review-friendly source-data mirrors may exist under `docs/source_data/`, but the original `experiments/...` artifacts remain authoritative unless a future document explicitly says otherwise.

## Utility Checks

Path verification:

```bash
python scripts/verify_doc_source_paths.py
```

Generic seed-summary helper:

```bash
python scripts/compute_seed_metric_summary.py --help
```

The seed-summary helper requires explicit input/output paths and grouping columns. Its output is marked `human_review_required_before_citation`.

## Required Before Manuscript Submission

- Verify Exp11, Exp12, Exp13, Exp13.1, Exp13.2, and Exp14 commands on a fresh checkout where cited.
- Document runtime, expected outputs, seed counts, and hardware expectations for manuscript-critical runs.
- Add final figure regeneration commands and source-data manifests.
- Add seed-level confidence intervals and effect sizes for core claims.
- Import prior-art/novelty evidence as local source artifacts.
- Decide whether neural baselines are required for the intended target venue.
- Keep completed generated outputs immutable and create new run files for reruns.

# Reproducibility Audit

## Goal

Can a new researcher clone the repo, run key experiments, regenerate metrics, regenerate plots, and reproduce manuscript claims?

## Current status

Initial status: partially reproducible from local scripts and existing artifacts, but not yet manuscript-ready. This pass indexed discovered commands and outputs without executing experiments or validating regenerated results.

## Experiment run commands found

## Missing reproducibility items

- Standard run interface is inconsistent across experiments. Source path: launcher scripts indexed above.
- Validation commands are not uniformly documented. Source path: `docs/repo_audit/MISSING_ARTIFACTS.md`.
- Per-run database immutability is visible in several `runs/` folders but not yet audited against every launcher. Source path: `docs/repo_audit/ARTIFACT_INDEX.csv`.
- Environment/GPU expectations need a single documented path. Source path: `check_gpu_status.py`.

## Recommended standard run interface

Propose a consistent pattern, for example:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\start_exp<N>.ps1 -Profile smoke -Clean
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\start_exp<N>.ps1 -Profile standard -Clean
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\start_exp<N>.ps1 -Profile full -Clean
```

## Required before manuscript submission

- Confirm exact run and validation commands for every experiment used in the manuscript.
- Document expected runtime, GPU usage, seeds, and output paths.
- Verify that completed runs write separate immutable SQLite files where applicable.
- Add smoke/standard/full profiles for manuscript-critical experiments or document why unavailable.

# Experiment 2: Persistent Plastic Graph MNIST Prototype

## Evidence status

- Local artifacts reviewed: README/design docs, generated reports, CSV summaries, validation outputs where present, and plot filenames
- Thread digest reviewed: yes; no non-empty Exp2-specific result digest was available
- Claims validated: local-only first pass; human review still required
- Needs human review: yes

## Status

- Code present: yes
- Analysis artifacts present: yes
- Validation present: no
- Thread digest present: empty `docs/threads/experiment1to4_export.md`; background mentions only
- Manuscript relevance: Historical/supplemental MNIST learning evidence.

## Purpose

This is a research prototype for a **persistent plastic graph network**: a sparse, stateful, reward-modulated learning substrate trained on MNIST. It is intentionally not a giant monolithic neural-network script. The core pieces are separated: - `config.py` - experiment configuration - `storage.py` - SQLite/SQLAlchemy persistence for runs, metrics, checkpoints - `data.py` - MNIST loading - `plastic_graph.py` - sparse adaptive graph substrate - `modulators.py` - reward/novelty/confidence plasticity gates - `trainer.py` - experiment loop - `run_mnist_experiment.py` - composition/root script Or use the included helper scripts: Results are persisted to `runs/plastic_graph_mnist.sqlite3` by defau

Source path: `experiment2/README.md`

## Hypothesis

TODO: Import the pre-run hypothesis from the relevant ChatGPT thread digest or local design document section. This first pass only consolidates local post-run artifacts.

## Experimental design

## Key results

### Result 1: Completed MNIST prototype run

Claim: Exp2 has a completed MNIST prototype run with best reported test accuracy 0.9225.
Evidence: The generated analysis report states best test accuracy 0.9225 at step 27500 and latest test accuracy 0.9190 at step 30000.
Caveat: Single prototype run; MNIST does not test route-memory composition.
Source path: `experiment2/analysis/analysis_report.md`

## What this experiment supports

- Local evidence summarized above; final supported-claim language must be imported into `docs/manuscript/CLAIMS_AND_EVIDENCE.md` after human/thread review.

## What this experiment does not prove

- Does not establish novelty by itself.
- Does not remove the need for baseline and reproducibility review.

## Known implementation or interpretation caveats

- Thread digest has not been reviewed.
- Check run profile, seeds, and aggregation before manuscript use.

## Key results (thread-integrated)

No thread-derived route-memory result is imported for Exp2.

## What this experiment supports (thread-integrated)

- Historical MNIST/plastic-graph context only.

## What this experiment does not prove (thread-integrated)

- It does not support the manuscript's context-indexed route-memory claims.

## Follow-up actions (thread-integrated)

- Keep Exp2 as historical/supplemental unless early MNIST results are separately reviewed.

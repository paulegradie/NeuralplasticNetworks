# Historical and Exploratory Experiments

## Purpose

Exp1-Exp10 are not all equally central to the first manuscript. This document separates historical exploration, mechanism-building support, and manuscript-critical evidence so future edits do not accidentally upgrade old exploratory results into central claims.

Claim: The current manuscript-critical spine is Exp11-Exp13 plus planned Exp13.1 hardening.
Evidence: The experiment registry, manuscript spine, and publication-readiness docs all make Exp13.1, baselines, uncertainty, and final figures the next blockers.
Caveat: Supporting and historical experiments may still be useful for background or supplementary context, but they should not be treated as external baselines or final manuscript evidence without renewed validation.

## Experiment tiers

## Tier A - Manuscript-critical

Experiments: Exp11, Exp12, Exp13, planned Exp13.1.

Role:

- Provides the current first-manuscript spine: context-separated incompatible-world memory, clean-context scaling, boundary mapping, and planned publication hardening.

How it may be used:

- Use for central manuscript evidence only with the caveats in `docs/manuscript/CLAIMS_AND_EVIDENCE.md`.
- Use Exp13.1 only after it exists as a new experiment under `experiments/` and has local artifacts.

How it should not be used:

- Do not claim submission readiness before external baselines, uncertainty reporting, Exp13.1 cleanup, and final figures.
- Do not modify Exp13 in place to implement successor hardening.

| Experiment | Directory | Summary doc | Manuscript role | Caveat |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Exp11 | `experiments/experiment11_context_memory/` | `docs/experiments/exp11_summary.md` | Candidate main context-separated memory evidence. | Oracle world context; external baselines and intervals pending. |
| Exp12 | `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/` | `docs/experiments/exp12_summary.md` | Candidate main capacity/scaling evidence. | Ceiling-limited; context-noise sweeps are diagnostic, not final robustness evidence. |
| Exp13 | `experiments/experiment13_breaking_point/` | `docs/experiments/exp13_summary.md` | Candidate main boundary-mapping evidence. | Metric cleanup, clean ablations, stochastic context corruption, and capacity-law summaries pending. |
| Exp13.1 | planned future `experiments/exp13_1_publication_hardening/` or equivalent | planned future `docs/experiments/exp13_1_summary.md` or equivalent | Publication hardening successor. | Not yet implemented; planned only. |

## Tier B - Mechanism-building / supporting

Experiments: Exp7, Exp8, Exp9, Exp10.

Role:

- Builds mechanism intuition for route fields, self-organizing acquisition, robustness stressors, and stability-plasticity tradeoffs.

How it may be used:

- Use as background, mechanism support, or supplementary evidence when tied to current source paths and caveats.
- Use Exp7/Exp8 to explain route-table versus recurrent execution mechanics.

How it should not be used:

- Do not treat supporting internal ablations as external baselines.
- Do not make broad biological, continual-learning, or robustness claims from these experiments alone.

| Experiment | Directory | Summary doc | Manuscript role | Caveat |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Exp7 | `experiments/experiment7_route_field_diagnostics/` | `docs/experiments/exp7_summary.md` | Diagnostic route-field support. | Clean diagnostic setting; not self-organized acquisition. |
| Exp8 | `experiments/experiment8_self_organizing_route_acquisition/` | `docs/experiments/exp8_summary.md` | Supporting mechanism evidence for route-field acquisition. | Synthetic symbolic task; external baselines pending. |
| Exp9 | `experiments/experiment9_robust_adaptive_route_plasticity/` | `docs/experiments/exp9_summary.md` | Supporting robustness and stressor evidence. | Effects are stress-dependent; not required in every clean regime. |
| Exp10 | `experiments/experiment10_adaptive_reversal/` | `docs/experiments/exp10_summary.md` | Supporting stability-plasticity and reversal evidence. | Adaptive rebinding, not non-destructive multi-world memory. |

## Tier C - Historical / exploratory

Experiments: Exp1, Exp2, Exp3, Exp4, Exp5, Exp6.

Role:

- Records the exploratory path from MNIST/plastic-graph prototypes to route traversal and corrected route audits.

How it may be used:

- Use for project history, motivation, and negative or caveated methodological lessons.
- Use only with local artifacts and explicit caveats if any exact number is cited.

How it should not be used:

- Do not use as central evidence for the first route-memory manuscript unless later docs explicitly elevate a specific result.
- Do not cite as external baselines or as proof of the final mechanism.

| Experiment | Directory | Summary doc | Manuscript role | Caveat |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Exp1 | `experiments/experiment1/` | `docs/experiments/exp1_summary.md` | Historical implementation background. | No non-empty Exp1-specific result digest; no central route-memory claim. |
| Exp2 | `experiments/experiment2/` | `docs/experiments/exp2_summary.md` | Historical MNIST/plastic-graph evidence. | Classification prototype; not route-memory composition. |
| Exp3 | `experiments/experiment3/` | `docs/experiments/exp3_summary.md` | Historical motivation for moving beyond MNIST. | MNIST suite did not isolate recurrent traversal. |
| Exp4 | `experiments/experiment4_successor/` | `docs/experiments/exp4_summary.md` | Early traversal contrast. | Single successor task; no incompatible context-conditioned worlds. |
| Exp5 | `experiments/experiment5_contextual_successor/` | `docs/experiments/exp5_summary.md` | Caveated contextual-successor precursor. | Low composition and traversal-loop ambiguity. |
| Exp6 | `experiments/experiment6_route_audit_successor/` | `docs/experiments/exp6_summary.md` | Corrected route-audit failure/diagnostic precursor. | Negative but informative; not robust contextual route memory. |

## Purpose

Experiment 5 introduced contextual successor rules, but the review pass uncovered a methodological problem: the traversal loop reconstituted the symbolic concept-plus-context state after every recurrent step. That made several context metrics partly tautological and weakened the meaning of the route-selection claims. Experiment 6 asks: > If we stop rebuilding the symbolic state after every step and instead audit the raw recurrent trajectory, can the graph still choose the right transition family under context and compose it across multiple steps? The task introduces several context-dependent transition rules over the same number concepts: The same start state can now map to different next st

## Key results

### Result 1: Raw route audit still shows low composition

Claim: Exp6 local artifacts show low absolute composition accuracy under the corrected raw recurrent trajectory audit.
Evidence: `exp6_full_route_audit` has best_composition_accuracy=0.1516; the highest row is `exp6_no_context_routing` at 0.1639.
Caveat: This is evidence of a failure/diagnostic condition, not a capability success.

## Thread-derived analysis

### Analysis source: `docs/threads/experiment6_export.md`

Completed result / design / caveat / decision: Completed result with caveat.
Evidence: The thread concludes Exp6 is negative-but-informative: recurrence and structural plasticity are load-bearing, but the full model does not robustly solve context-conditioned composition under a raw recurrent audit.
Caveat: No statistical reruns or seed analysis were discussed; endpoint accuracy alone was judged insufficient.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment6_export.md`
Related local artifact path: `experiments/experiment6_route_audit_successor/analysis/exp6/exp6_report.md`; `experiments/experiment6_route_audit_successor/analysis/exp6/exp6_comparison.csv`
Status: Preliminary

## Key results (thread-integrated)

### Result 1: Raw recurrent audit is negative but informative

Claim: Exp6 does not validate robust context-conditioned compositional route traversal.
Evidence: Local comparison reports `exp6_full_route_audit` best composition accuracy 0.1516, and the thread states the full model's correct route did not dominate competing routes.
Caveat: The result is not a total architectural failure because recurrence and structural plasticity remain load-bearing.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment6_export.md`
Source artifact: `experiments/experiment6_route_audit_successor/analysis/exp6/exp6_comparison.csv`; `experiments/experiment6_route_audit_successor/analysis/exp6/exp6_route_margin.png`
Manuscript status: Historical only

### Result 2: Recurrence and structural plasticity are load-bearing but insufficient

Claim: Removing recurrence or structural plasticity damages Exp6 performance, but the full model still fails reliable route control.
Evidence: `exp6_no_recurrence` has 0.0 best composition and transition accuracy; `exp6_no_structural_plasticity` has best composition about 0.041, below the full model.
Caveat: Necessity in this setup does not imply sufficiency for robust compositional memory.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment6_export.md`
Source artifact: `experiments/experiment6_route_audit_successor/analysis/exp6/exp6_comparison.csv`
Manuscript status: Preliminary

### Result 3: Context identity is not route execution

Claim: Exp6 distinguishes preserving context identity from executing the correct context-conditioned route.
Evidence: The thread reports a diagonal context-confusion plot while best composition remained low and route margins were negative.
Caveat: The context-confusion metric itself may need deeper audit.

Source artifact: `experiments/experiment6_route_audit_successor/analysis/exp6/exp6_context_confusion.png`; `experiments/experiment6_route_audit_successor/analysis/exp6/exp6_report.md`
Manuscript status: Promising

## What this experiment supports (thread-integrated)

- Route-margin metrics are necessary to avoid overclaiming.
- Recurrence and structural plasticity can be load-bearing without solving route selection.

## What this experiment does not prove (thread-integrated)

- It does not prove robust context-conditioned route memory.
- It does not prove context routing is harmful; the no-context-routing endpoint score is ambiguous.

## Follow-up actions (thread-integrated)

- Fix stale Exp6 README wording in a docs-only cleanup.
- Consider a multi-seed rerun only if exact Exp6 numeric comparisons are used.

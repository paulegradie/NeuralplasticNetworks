## Purpose

Experiment 4 showed that recurrence and structural plasticity become load-bearing when the task actually requires traversal. The next question is whether the graph can do something more interesting than learn a single reusable chain. Experiment 5 asks: > Can the same recurrent plastic graph choose among multiple transition systems based on context, then compose the chosen route over several steps? The task introduces several context-dependent transition rules over the same number concepts: The same start state can now map to different next states depending on context: The graph therefore has to do more than memorize one successor chain. It has to preserve context, keep competing routes apart

## Key results

### Result 1: Contextual successor smoke suite remains low

Claim: Exp5 local smoke artifacts do not show reliable contextual multi-step composition.
Evidence: The suite smoke comparison has maximum best_composition_accuracy=0.1471 for `exp5_full_contextual_traversal`; the full contextual traversal row reports best_composition_accuracy=0.1471.
Caveat: Exp6 README identifies a traversal-loop ambiguity in Exp5, so Exp5 should be treated as caveated/deprecated until thread review.

## Thread-derived analysis

### Analysis source: `docs/threads/experiment5to10_export.md`

Completed result / design / caveat / decision: Completed result with caveat.
Evidence: The thread describes Exp5 as a mechanistic partial success but not a capability success; full composition was low, around 0.147, while no-recurrence was 0 and no-structural-plasticity was around 0.088.
Caveat: The thread notes small denominators and low absolute accuracy; context confusion looked strong but did not imply route traversal success.

Related local artifact path: `experiment5_contextual_successor/analysis/exp5_suite_smoke/exp5_comparison.csv`; `experiment5_contextual_successor/analysis/exp5_suite_smoke/exp5_report.md`
Status: Historical only

### Analysis source: `docs/threads/experiment6_export.md`

Completed result / design / caveat / decision: Identified flaw.
Evidence: The Exp6 thread says Exp5 reconstructed the symbolic concept-plus-context state after each recurrent step, weakening claims about raw recurrent route selection.
Caveat: This does not invalidate Exp5 as motivation, but it prevents treating Exp5 as a solved contextual traversal result.

## Key results (thread-integrated)

### Result 1: Mechanistic partial success, not capability success

Claim: Exp5 should be treated as a motivating failure/diagnostic precursor rather than evidence of reliable context-conditioned composition.
Evidence: Local suite smoke shows `exp5_full_contextual_traversal` best composition accuracy 0.1471; the thread independently identifies low composition and misleadingly strong context-confusion behavior.
Caveat: Traversal-loop reconstruction makes raw recurrent route-selection claims unsafe.

Manuscript status: Historical only

## What this experiment supports (thread-integrated)

- Motivation for route-field diagnostics and raw recurrent audits.
- Evidence that context identity alone was not enough for reliable route execution.

## What this experiment does not prove (thread-integrated)

- It does not prove robust context-conditioned composition.
- It does not prove world/context indexing solves destructive interference.

## Follow-up actions (thread-integrated)

- Cite Exp5 only as a caveated precursor if it appears in the manuscript.

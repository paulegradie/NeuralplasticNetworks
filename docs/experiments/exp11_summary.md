## Purpose

Experiments 7-9 established a route-field mechanism: Experiment 10 showed adaptive rule reversal. A learned route field can be rebound when mode meanings change, and consolidation controls the stability-plasticity tradeoff. But the strongest ordinary reversal behavior was still mostly overwrite: new rule B replaced old rule A under the same context labels. Experiment 11 tests whether a higher-level world context allows multiple rule systems to coexist without destructive overwrite. A higher-order context signal can bind route fields into separable memory worlds, allowing the same mode labels to have different transition semantics in different task contexts. Train A, consolidate, then train B

## Key results

### Result 1: Context-separated full model retains and acquires route systems locally

Claim: Exp11 memory indices report 1.0 retention of A after B and 1.0 acquisition of B after A for the full context-separated-memory variant.
Evidence: `exp11_full_context_separated_memory`: retention_A_after_B=1.0, acquisition_B_after_A=1.0, route_retention_A_after_B=1.0, route_acquisition_B_after_A=1.0.
Caveat: Synthetic world-context task; not a complete continual-learning solution.
Source path: `experiment11_context_memory/analysis/exp11/exp11_memory_indices.csv`; `experiment11_context_memory/analysis/exp11/exp11_report.md`

### Result 2: No recurrence preserves route tables but loses sequential composition

Claim: The no-recurrence memory-index row has route retention/acquisition at 1.0 but composition retention/acquisition at 0.0.
Evidence: `exp11_no_recurrence`: retention_A_after_B=0.0, acquisition_B_after_A=0.0, route_retention_A_after_B=1.0, route_acquisition_B_after_A=1.0.
Caveat: Interpretation should remain benchmark-specific.
Source path: `experiment11_context_memory/analysis/exp11/exp11_memory_indices.csv`

### Result 3: No structural plasticity and no world context degrade memory indices

Claim: No-structural-plasticity is near zero and no-world-context is partial on A retention in the local memory-index table.
Evidence: `exp11_no_structural_plasticity`: retention_A_after_B=0.0306, acquisition_B_after_A=0.0283; `exp11_no_world_context`: retention_A_after_B=0.2895, acquisition_B_after_A=1.0.
Caveat: No-world-context still acquires B in this table; claims should be about interference/retention, not total failure.

### Analysis source: `docs/threads/experiment5to10_export.md`

Completed result / design / caveat / decision: Design decision.
Evidence: The thread designed Exp11 to test true context-separated memory after Exp10's ambiguous dual-context result.
Caveat: This earlier thread did not analyze full Exp11 local results.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment5to10_export.md`

Status: Design only

### Analysis source: `docs/threads/experiment11_export`

Completed result / design / caveat / decision: Completed result with caveat.
Evidence: The thread analyzes Exp11 full and world-gated variants retaining A while acquiring B; no-recurrence separates route-table memory from composition; no-structural-plasticity and no-world-context variants fail in interpretable ways.
Caveat: Synthetic task; no external baselines, no formal confidence intervals, and no capacity-limit proof in Exp11 alone.

### Analysis source: `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`

Completed result / design / caveat / decision: Manuscript framing decision.
Evidence: The thread treats Exp11 as the backbone of the narrowed claim: structural storage, contextual retrieval, and recurrent execution.
Caveat: Exp11 was not reanalyzed directly in that thread; rely on `docs/threads/experiment11_export` for Exp11 result details.

## Key results (thread-integrated)

### Result 1: Full model retains A and acquires B

Claim: Exp11 supports non-destructive retention across two incompatible route worlds in the tested symbolic regime.
Evidence: `exp11_full_context_separated_memory` has retention_A_after_B 1.0, acquisition_B_after_A 1.0, and route retention/acquisition 1.0.
Caveat: Oracle world context is supplied; broader continual-learning baselines are absent.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment11_export`
Source artifact: `experiment11_context_memory/analysis/exp11/exp11_memory_indices.csv`
Manuscript status: Strong

### Result 2: Recurrence separates storage from execution

Claim: Exp11 no-recurrence preserves route tables but fails composed behavior.
Evidence: `exp11_no_recurrence` has route_retention_A_after_B and route_acquisition_B_after_A at 1.0, while retention_A_after_B and acquisition_B_after_A are 0.0.
Caveat: Benchmark-specific; not a universal recurrence claim.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment11_export`
Source artifact: `experiment11_context_memory/analysis/exp11/exp11_memory_indices.csv`; `experiment11_context_memory/analysis/exp11/exp11_sequential_route_table.png`
Manuscript status: Strong

### Result 3: No world context shows destructive interference

Claim: Without world context, Exp11 acquires B but loses much of A, consistent with collision/overwrite.
Evidence: `exp11_no_world_context` has acquisition_B_after_A 1.0 but retention_A_after_B about 0.2895; shared-edges-only has the same pattern in the thread.
Caveat: Phrase as retention/interference, not total failure.

Source artifact: `experiment11_context_memory/analysis/exp11/exp11_memory_indices.csv`; `experiment11_context_memory/analysis/exp11/exp11_failure_taxonomy_final_sequential.png`
Manuscript status: Strong

### Result 4: Consolidation and inhibition are not essential in this clean regime

Claim: Exp11 does not support a claim that consolidation or inhibition is essential for clean context-separated memory.
Evidence: The thread and local memory indices show no-consolidation and no-inhibition variants at 1.0 retention/acquisition.
Caveat: They may matter under pressure, noise, or capacity limits.

## Purpose

Experiment 10 tests the next unresolved question after Experiment 9: > Can a graph change a learned route system without destroying itself? Experiments 7-9 established the mechanism stack: - clean route fields compose recurrently; - local structural plasticity can self-organize those route fields from one-step experience; - context binding separates route families; - inhibition protects route margins under context interference; - reward gating and eligibility traces become load-bearing under noisy or delayed feedback. Experiment 10 now probes the stability-plasticity tradeoff. The model first learns rule set A, then the mode meanings are changed to rule set B. We measure new-rule adaptation,

## Key results

### Result 1: Adaptive reversal changes final rule performance in local summary

Claim: The main Exp10 adaptation-threshold summary reports high final B accuracy for the full adaptive-reversal variant and lower final A retention.
Evidence: `exp10_full_adaptive_reversal`: final B accuracy=0.9996, B adaptation_threshold_80=3.0; final A accuracy=0.2895.
Caveat: This does not prove non-destructive continual learning; it shows adaptation with old-rule loss in this summary.
Source path: `experiment10_adaptive_reversal/analysis/exp10/exp10_adaptation_thresholds.csv`

### Result 2: Strong consolidation shifts the reversal tradeoff

Claim: The strong-consolidation row retains A substantially more than the full adaptive-reversal row but has low final B accuracy.
Evidence: `exp10_strong_consolidation`: final A accuracy=0.9276, final B accuracy=0.2897.
Caveat: Validation-full outputs are smaller and differ in magnitude; treat as preliminary until reviewed.
Source path: `experiment10_adaptive_reversal/analysis/exp10/exp10_adaptation_thresholds.csv`; `experiment10_adaptive_reversal/analysis/exp10_validation_full/exp10_adaptation_thresholds.csv`

### Result 3: No structural plasticity does not adapt in the main summary

Claim: The no-structural-plasticity row has low final B accuracy.
Evidence: `exp10_no_structural_plasticity` final B accuracy=0.0305.
Caveat: The summary uses generated aggregate values; inspect run profiles before manuscript use.

## Thread-derived analysis

### Analysis source: `docs/threads/experiment5to10_export.md`

Completed result / design / caveat / decision: Completed result with caveat.
Evidence: The thread says Exp10 demonstrated adaptive route rebinding and a measurable stability-plasticity tradeoff: the full model adapted to rule B while old A dropped toward overlap baseline; strong consolidation retained A but blocked B; no-consolidation adapted quickly but switchback behavior was poor.
Caveat: The full model mostly overwrote old A under the same context labels; this is not non-destructive memory.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment5to10_export.md`
Related local artifact path: `experiment10_adaptive_reversal/analysis/exp10/exp10_adaptation_thresholds.csv`; `experiment10_adaptive_reversal/analysis/exp10/exp10_report.md`
Status: Promising

## Key results (thread-integrated)

### Result 1: Adaptive rebinding, not non-destructive memory

Claim: Exp10 supports adaptive route rebinding after rule reversal, but not preservation of both rules under the same context.
Evidence: Local adaptation thresholds show full B final accuracy near 1.0 while A final accuracy is about 0.2895; the thread interprets this as overwrite/adaptation.
Caveat: Do not present as solved continual retention.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment5to10_export.md`
Source artifact: `experiment10_adaptive_reversal/analysis/exp10/exp10_adaptation_thresholds.csv`
Manuscript status: Promising

### Result 2: Consolidation exposes a stability-plasticity tradeoff

Claim: Strong consolidation preserves old A but blocks new B in Exp10.
Evidence: Local threshold summary shows `exp10_strong_consolidation` final A accuracy about 0.9276 and final B accuracy about 0.2897.
Caveat: Consolidation levels may be too strong and require tuning.

Source artifact: `experiment10_adaptive_reversal/analysis/exp10/exp10_adaptation_thresholds.csv`
Manuscript status: Promising

### Result 3: Dual-context result is ambiguous

Claim: Exp10 dual-context worlds hint at recoverable separated memories but do not prove non-destructive retention.
Evidence: The thread reports B reached 1.0 and A recovered after switchback, but A was not retained during initial B learning.
Caveat: Could reflect retraining, latent recoverability, or context-access issues.

## What this experiment supports (thread-integrated)

- Adaptive rebinding and stability-plasticity tradeoff framing.

## What this experiment does not prove (thread-integrated)

- It does not prove non-destructive multi-world memory; Exp11 addresses that directly.

## Follow-up actions (thread-integrated)

- Use Exp10 as precursor/supplemental support for the consolidation framing, not as the central memory result.

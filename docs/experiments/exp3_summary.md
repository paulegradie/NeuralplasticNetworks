- Claims validated: local-only first pass; human review still required
- Needs human review: yes

## Status

- Code present: yes
- Analysis artifacts present: yes

- Thread digest present: empty `docs/threads/experiment1to4_export.md`; background mentions in `docs/threads/experiment5to10_export.md`
- Manuscript relevance: Historical/supplemental MNIST ablation evidence.

## Purpose

This project is a small experimental framework for testing a biologically inspired learning-machine idea: > Instead of treating a model as a dense static sea of matrices, treat it as a sparse persistent graph of adaptive units whose active pathways can be reinforced, weakened, and inspected over time. This is **not** intended to beat CNNs on MNIST. MNIST is used because it gives us a clean, cheap proving ground for the learning dynamics. Can a small sparse graph substrate learn useful behavior through online reward-modulated plasticity? More specifically, can it: 1. Activate only a small subset of units per example. 2. Learn from immediate `yes/no` correction. 3. Strengthen useful active pat

## Hypothesis

TODO: Import the pre-run hypothesis from the relevant ChatGPT thread digest or local design document section. This first pass only consolidates local post-run artifacts.

## Local report summary

- `experiment3/analysis/suite/suite_report.md`: This report compares controlled variants of the sparse plastic graph model. The goal is not merely to maximize MNIST accuracy; the goal is to identify which architectural mechanisms actually contribute to stable, generalizable online learning. - **Best accuracy**: best recorded test accuracy. This is the headline performance metric. - **Generalization gap**: latest train window accuracy minus latest test accuracy. A

## Key results

### Result 1: MNIST ablations do not isolate recurrent traversal

Claim: The Exp3 suite report shows no-recurrence and no-reward-modulation MNIST variants matching or exceeding the full recurrent variant on best test accuracy.
Evidence: The report table lists best test accuracy 0.9285 for `no_reward_modulation`, 0.9255 for `no_recurrence_sparse_plastic_readout`, and 0.9230 for `full_recurrent_plastic_graph`.
Caveat: This is a classification benchmark, not a route-memory benchmark; duplicate rows appear in the generated report table.

## What this experiment supports

- Local evidence summarized above; final supported-claim language must be imported into `docs/manuscript/CLAIMS_AND_EVIDENCE.md` after human/thread review.

## What this experiment does not prove

- Does not establish novelty by itself.
- Does not remove the need for baseline and reproducibility review.

## Known implementation or interpretation caveats

- Thread digest has not been reviewed.
- Check run profile, seeds, and aggregation before manuscript use.

- Update central claims/evidence rows if this experiment remains manuscript-relevant.

## Thread-derived analysis

### Analysis source: `docs/threads/experiment1to4_export.md`

Completed result / design / caveat / decision: No importable content.
Evidence: The digest file is present but empty.
Caveat: No Exp3 result was imported from this file.

Status: Historical only

### Analysis source: `docs/threads/experiment5to10_export.md`

Completed result / design / caveat / decision: Completed result with caveat, background only.
Evidence: The thread says Exp3 was a recurrent MNIST suite where recurrence was measurable but not clearly useful on MNIST.
Caveat: The thread did not reanalyze Exp3 artifacts in detail; keep this as background rather than a manuscript claim.

## Key results (thread-integrated)

No central route-memory result is imported for Exp3.

## What this experiment supports (thread-integrated)

- Historical motivation for moving beyond MNIST to tasks requiring traversal.

## What this experiment does not prove (thread-integrated)

- It does not prove recurrence is generally unnecessary; the caveat is specific to the MNIST suite discussed as background.

## Follow-up actions (thread-integrated)

- Mention Exp3 only as motivation if the manuscript needs a brief experimental history.

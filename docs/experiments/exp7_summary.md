## Purpose

Experiment 7 is the diagnostic follow-up to the contextual successor problem. Experiment 5 asked whether the graph could choose among multiple transition systems using context and then compose the selected route over several recurrent steps. The result was mechanistically useful but not yet a capability success: recurrence was clearly load-bearing, context routing helped, and structural plasticity helped, but the full model did not reliably compose contextual routes. Experiment 7 therefore does **not** make the task harder. It makes the mechanism easier to inspect. > When contextual traversal fails, does it fail because the graph did not learn the local transition table, did not preserve con

## Key results

### Result 1: Clean route field composes when recurrence is present

Claim: The unsaturated Exp7 summary reports full-route-field transition and composition accuracy of 1.0.
Evidence: `exp7_full_route_field` has transition_accuracy=1.0 and composition_accuracy=1.0.
Caveat: Exp7 is diagnostic and supplies/controls route fields; it is not the full acquisition story.
Source path: `experiment7_route_field_diagnostics/analysis/exp7.unsaturated/exp7_summary.csv`; `experiment7_route_field_diagnostics/analysis/exp7.unsaturated/exp7_report.md`

### Result 2: No recurrence preserves one-step route knowledge but loses composition

Claim: The no-recurrence row keeps transition accuracy at 1.0 while composition accuracy is 0.0.
Evidence: `exp7_no_recurrence` has transition_accuracy=1.0, composition_accuracy=0.0, and route_table_accuracy=1.0.
Caveat: Diagnostic setting; thread review still needed for interpretation language.
Source path: `experiment7_route_field_diagnostics/analysis/exp7.unsaturated/exp7_summary.csv`; `experiment7_route_field_diagnostics/analysis/exp7.unsaturated/exp7_route_summary.csv`

### Result 3: No structural plasticity is near chance in this diagnostic

Claim: The no-structural-plasticity row reports low transition and composition accuracy.
Evidence: `exp7_no_structural_plasticity` has transition_accuracy=0.0322 and composition_accuracy=0.0288.
Caveat: Does not by itself prove a general structural-plasticity theorem.

## Thread-derived analysis

### Analysis source: `docs/threads/experiment5to10_export.md`

Completed result / design / caveat / decision: Completed result with caveat.
Evidence: The thread says clean route fields compose perfectly when recurrence is present; no-recurrence preserves one-step transition knowledge but fails composition; no-context-binding and no-structural-plasticity degrade.
Caveat: The first Exp7 run was saturated; the unsaturated scale/anti-saturation run is the cleaner diagnostic result.

Related local artifact path: `experiment7_route_field_diagnostics/analysis/exp7.unsaturated/exp7_summary.csv`; `experiment7_route_field_diagnostics/analysis/exp7.unsaturated/exp7_report.md`
Status: Strong

## Key results (thread-integrated)

### Result 1: Clean route fields compose with recurrence

Claim: Exp7 shows that a clean context-conditioned route table can be composed recurrently.
Evidence: Unsaturated local artifacts show `exp7_full_route_field` transition and composition accuracy 1.0, while `exp7_no_recurrence` has transition accuracy 1.0 and composition 0.0.
Caveat: Exp7 is diagnostic and does not by itself prove route-field acquisition.

Source artifact: `experiment7_route_field_diagnostics/analysis/exp7.unsaturated/exp7_summary.csv`; `experiment7_route_field_diagnostics/analysis/exp7.unsaturated/exp7_route_summary.csv`
Manuscript status: Strong

## What this experiment supports (thread-integrated)

- Recurrence is needed to execute multi-step routes once local transition structure exists.
- Context binding and structural plasticity are meaningful diagnostic controls.

## What this experiment does not prove (thread-integrated)

- It does not show self-organization from one-step experience; Exp8 addresses that.

## Follow-up actions (thread-integrated)

- Use unsaturated Exp7 artifacts if this experiment appears in a supplementary mechanism figure.

## Purpose

Experiment 4 moves beyond MNIST because MNIST did not strongly require recurrent graph traversal. The previous ablations showed that recurrence was measurable but not clearly useful; the no-recurrence model performed about as well as the full recurrent model. That suggested the task was too perceptual and one-shot. This experiment asks a sharper question: > Can a sparse recurrent plastic graph learn a local transition rule and then compose that rule repeatedly to solve a task it was not directly trained on? The task is successor arithmetic: The model is trained on one-step transitions only. Multi-step addition is a held-out traversal test. MNIST can be solved by a shallow mapping: That does

- `experiment4_successor/analysis/exp4/exp4_report.md`: This experiment asks a sharper question than MNIST: can a recurrent plastic graph learn a local successor transition and compose it repeatedly to solve addition-like tasks it was not directly trained on? A strong result would show `exp4_full_traversal` beating `exp4_no_recurrence` on multi-step addition, not merely matching it on one-step transitions. Key things to inspect: - `best_addition_accuracy`: whether travers

## Key results

### Result 1: Single successor traversal separates mechanism ablations

Claim: Exp4 locally reports perfect transition and addition accuracy for the full traversal variant, with collapse in no-recurrence and no-structural-plasticity ablations.
Evidence: `exp4_full_traversal` has best_addition_accuracy=1.0; `exp4_no_recurrence` has best_addition_accuracy=0.0; `exp4_no_structural_plasticity` has best_addition_accuracy=0.0349.
Caveat: Single controlled successor task; later experiments test harder contextual route systems.

## Thread-derived analysis

### Analysis source: `docs/threads/experiment6_export.md`

Completed result / design / caveat / decision: Completed result with caveat.
Evidence: The thread treats Exp4 as a single universal successor-route contrast where route ambiguity was limited.
Caveat: Exp4 does not test incompatible context-conditioned worlds.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment6_export.md`
Related local artifact path: `experiment4_successor/analysis/exp4/exp4_report.md`
Status: Historical only

### Analysis source: `docs/threads/experiment5to10_export.md`

Completed result / design / caveat / decision: Manuscript framing decision.
Evidence: The thread uses Exp4 as prior motivation for Exp5 because traversal made recurrence and structural plasticity more load-bearing than earlier MNIST tasks.
Caveat: The central manuscript mechanism is supported by later context/world experiments, not Exp4 alone.

## Key results (thread-integrated)

### Result 1: First traversal contrast

Claim: Exp4 is useful as historical evidence that a traversal task made recurrence/structural plasticity more relevant than MNIST-style classification.
Evidence: The thread frames Exp4 as the predecessor motivating contextual successor experiments.
Caveat: This is a historical motivation claim, not a central manuscript result about context-separated memory.

## What this experiment supports (thread-integrated)

- Route-composition motivation for later experiments.

## What this experiment does not prove (thread-integrated)

- It does not prove world/context indexing or non-destructive memory.

## Follow-up actions (thread-integrated)

- Keep Exp4 in background or supplementary history unless the manuscript needs the early traversal contrast.

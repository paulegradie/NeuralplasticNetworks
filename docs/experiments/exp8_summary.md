## Purpose

Experiment 7 showed that a clean context-conditioned route field can be composed recurrently. Experiment 8 asks the missing bridge question: > Can a local plastic graph acquire that clean context-conditioned route field from one-step transition experience, then solve unseen multi-step traversal queries by recurrence? The model trains only on local transitions such as: It is then evaluated on held-out composition tasks such as: The main experiment should keep `--path-train-repeats 0`, so the model never directly trains on the final multi-step answers. A recurrent graph with context-bound structural plasticity can acquire local transition routes from sparse experience, and once those routes re

## Key results

### Result 1: Self-organized route field reaches perfect local metrics in the main summary

Claim: The main Exp8 summary reports 1.0 transition, route-table, and composition accuracy for the full self-organizing route-field variant across 30 seeds.
Evidence: `exp8_full_self_organizing_route_field`: transition_accuracy_mean=1.0, route_table_accuracy_mean=1.0, composition_accuracy_mean=1.0, n_seeds=30.
Caveat: Synthetic symbolic route world; thread/human review needed before final manuscript wording.
Source path: `experiment8_self_organizing_route_acquisition/analysis/exp8/exp8_summary.csv`; `experiment8_self_organizing_route_acquisition/analysis/exp8/exp8_report.md`

### Result 2: No recurrence separates route storage from route execution

Claim: The no-recurrence Exp8 row keeps transition and route-table accuracy at 1.0 while composition accuracy is 0.0.
Evidence: `exp8_no_recurrence`: transition_accuracy_mean=1.0, route_table_accuracy_mean=1.0, composition_accuracy_mean=0.0.
Caveat: Interpret as local evidence for this benchmark family, not a universal recurrence claim.
Source path: `experiment8_self_organizing_route_acquisition/analysis/exp8/exp8_summary.csv`

### Result 3: Structural-plasticity removal collapses acquisition in the main summary

Claim: The no-structural-plasticity Exp8 row reports low transition, route-table, and composition accuracy.
Evidence: `exp8_no_structural_plasticity`: transition_accuracy_mean=0.0257, route_table_accuracy_mean=0.0257, composition_accuracy_mean=0.0312.
Caveat: This supports a benchmark-specific mechanism claim, not biological necessity.
Source path: `experiment8_self_organizing_route_acquisition/analysis/exp8/exp8_summary.csv`

### Result 4: Context bleed degrades margins and composition relative to full

Claim: The context-bleed row has lower composition accuracy than the full row.
Evidence: `exp8_context_bleed`: composition_accuracy_mean=0.8338, compared with full composition_accuracy_mean=1.0.
Caveat: Needs thread review to distinguish route contamination from other causes.

## Thread-derived analysis

### Analysis source: `docs/threads/experiment5to10_export.md`

Completed result / design / caveat / decision: Completed result.
Evidence: The thread says Exp8 full self-organizing route field achieved 1.0 transition, composition, and route-table accuracy across 30 seeds with one exposure repeat; no-recurrence kept route-table accuracy but failed composition; no-structural-plasticity stayed near random.
Caveat: Controlled symbolic number world; exposure curve was later described as not a real curve and reward/homeostasis were not stressed.

Related local artifact path: `experiment8_self_organizing_route_acquisition/analysis/exp8/exp8_summary.csv`; `experiment8_self_organizing_route_acquisition/analysis/exp8/exp8_report.md`
Status: Strong

## Key results (thread-integrated)

### Result 1: Local plasticity can acquire a route field from one-step experience

Claim: Exp8 supports local structural plasticity forming a context-conditioned route table that recurrence can execute compositionally.
Evidence: Local summary shows `exp8_full_self_organizing_route_field` at 1.0 transition, route-table, and composition accuracy across 30 seeds.
Caveat: Synthetic symbolic benchmark; external baselines remain required.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment5to10_export.md`
Source artifact: `experiment8_self_organizing_route_acquisition/analysis/exp8/exp8_summary.csv`
Manuscript status: Strong

### Result 2: Route storage and route execution dissociate

Claim: Exp8 no-recurrence preserves local route memory but cannot perform multi-step composition.
Evidence: Local summary shows `exp8_no_recurrence` transition and route-table accuracy 1.0 with composition accuracy 0.0.
Caveat: This is a benchmark-specific internal ablation.

Manuscript status: Strong

## What this experiment supports (thread-integrated)

- Structural plasticity can acquire local route fields in the symbolic benchmark.
- Recurrence executes stored route fields.

## What this experiment does not prove (thread-integrated)

- It does not show noisy/delayed feedback robustness; Exp9 addresses stress.
- It does not prove biological plausibility.

## Follow-up actions (thread-integrated)

- Use Exp8 as an early core mechanism result only with explicit symbolic-task caveats.

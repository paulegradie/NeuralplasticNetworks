## Purpose

Experiment 8 showed that a local plastic graph can acquire a context-conditioned route field from one-step transition exposure, then use recurrence to compose unseen multi-step paths. Experiment 9 asks the next question: > Can the graph preserve, repair, and adapt those routes when context is unreliable and feedback is imperfect or delayed? This experiment is intentionally still symbolic. The goal is not to make the problem more semantically rich. The goal is to stress the mechanism that Experiment 8 validated. Does inhibition protect context-bound routes when competing context assemblies are partially active? The main stressor is `context_bleed`: a fraction of the wrong mode and wrong sourc

## Key results

### Result 1: Clean full reward-robust condition succeeds locally

Claim: The main Exp9 summary reports 1.0 transition, route-table, and composition accuracy for the full reward-robust variant under clean immediate feedback.
Evidence: `exp9_full_reward_robust` at feedback_noise=0.0/reward_delay_steps=0: transition_accuracy_mean=1.0, route_table_accuracy_mean=1.0, composition_accuracy_mean=1.0.
Caveat: Robustness interpretation requires reviewing the full stress grid.
Source path: `experiment9_robust_adaptive_route_plasticity/analysis/exp9/exp9_summary.csv`

### Result 2: Noisy delayed feedback lowers full-model composition and exposes ablations

Claim: Under feedback_noise=0.2 and reward_delay_steps=2, the full row degrades and no-eligibility-trace is much lower.
Evidence: Full reward-robust composition_accuracy_mean=0.3677; `exp9_no_eligibility_trace` composition_accuracy_mean=0.0312.
Caveat: This is a local stress-grid observation; causal interpretation needs thread/human review.
Source path: `experiment9_robust_adaptive_route_plasticity/analysis/exp9/exp9_summary.csv`

### Result 3: No recurrence again separates route table from composition

Claim: The no-recurrence feedback row keeps route-table accuracy at 1.0 but composition accuracy is 0.0 under clean feedback.
Evidence: `exp9_no_recurrence`: route_table_accuracy_mean=1.0, composition_accuracy_mean=0.0.
Caveat: Same synthetic route-memory benchmark family; avoid broad generalization language.

## Thread-derived analysis

### Analysis source: `docs/threads/experiment5to10_export.md`

Completed result / design / caveat / decision: Completed result with caveat.
Evidence: The thread says inhibition becomes load-bearing under context interference, and reward/eligibility mechanisms matter under noisy or delayed feedback.
Caveat: Effects are stress-dependent; inhibition is not required in clean deterministic settings.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment5to10_export.md`
Related local artifact path: `experiment9_robust_adaptive_route_plasticity/analysis/exp9/exp9_summary.csv`; `experiment9_robust_adaptive_route_plasticity/analysis/exp9/exp9_report.md`
Status: Promising

## Key results (thread-integrated)

### Result 1: Inhibition protects margins under context bleed

Claim: Exp9 supports inhibition as a stress-dependent route-margin protection mechanism.
Evidence: The thread reports full composition around 0.777 versus no-inhibition around 0.524 at context bleed 0.35, with matching route-table and margin trends.
Caveat: Thread-derived numerical comparison should be checked against the local stress-grid rows before final manuscript use.

Source artifact: `experiment9_robust_adaptive_route_plasticity/analysis/exp9/exp9_summary.csv`; `experiment9_robust_adaptive_route_plasticity/analysis/exp9/exp9_interference_composition_by_bleed.png`
Manuscript status: Promising

### Result 2: Eligibility traces matter under delayed feedback

Claim: Exp9 suggests eligibility traces protect route acquisition when reward is delayed.
Evidence: The thread says the no-eligibility-trace variant collapsed when reward delay was introduced, while the full model remained strong under zero-noise delayed reward.
Caveat: This is a stressor-specific result; do not claim eligibility is always necessary.

## What this experiment supports (thread-integrated)

- Robustness mechanisms become visible under the right stressors.

## What this experiment does not prove (thread-integrated)

- It does not prove inhibition, reward gating, or eligibility traces are required in clean tasks.

## Follow-up actions (thread-integrated)

- Use Exp9 as a supplementary robustness mechanism result unless the manuscript expands beyond the Exp11-Exp13 spine.

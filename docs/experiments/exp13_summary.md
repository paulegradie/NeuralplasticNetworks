## Purpose

Experiment 13 is designed as the first serious **boundary-mapping** experiment after Experiment 12. Experiment 12 showed that the current mechanism can remain saturated at perfect accuracy across many incompatible worlds. That was important, but a manuscript cannot rely only on ceiling effects. Experiment 13 deliberately pushes the model into regimes where it should fail. The purpose is to make the first manuscript harder to attack: 1. show where the full mechanism succeeds; 2. show where it breaks; 3. show that ablations fail for specific, mechanistically interpretable reasons; 4. separate memory composition from true unseen-transition inference; 5. bridge from symbolic route tables into a

## Local report summary

- `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/exp13_report.md`: Experiment 13 deliberately pushes the Experiment 12 mechanism out of the ceiling regime.

## Key results

### Result 1: Finite memory pressure creates an observed degradation curve

Claim: Exp13 validation and capacity summaries report perfect composition at exact budget and lower composition under low budget.
Evidence: Validation report states exact=1.0000 and low=0.3939. For world_count=32, route_length=12: budget_ratio=1.0 composition_accuracy_mean=1.0; budget_ratio=0.25 composition_accuracy_mean=0.2755.
Caveat: Validation PASS language is local to this generated validation script; manuscript claims still need review.
Source path: `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/validation_report.md`; `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/capacity_pressure_summary.csv`

### Result 2: Local budget pressure is visibly harsher for long routes in the local summary

Claim: The local-capacity summary shows very low composition at local_budget_ratio=0.25 for route_length=12.
Evidence: `exp13_full_context_separated_memory`, world_count=32, route_length=12, local_budget_ratio=0.25: composition_accuracy_mean=0.0417, route_route_table_accuracy_mean=0.2721.
Caveat: A formal local-vs-global comparison still needs a reviewed analysis table; keep this as preliminary.
Source path: `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/local_capacity_pressure_summary.csv`

### Result 3: Primitive holdout separates composition over seen primitives from unseen primitive transitions

Claim: The validation report explicitly marks primitive holdout as PASS and reports seen=0.8924, unseen=0.0747.
Evidence: CSV examples: compositions_from_seen_primitives route_length=8 composition_accuracy_mean=1.0; routes_requiring_unseen_primitives at primitive_holdout_rate=0.1 composition_accuracy_mean=0.1143.
Caveat: This is a boundary result, not broad abstract rule generalization.
Source path: `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/validation_report.md`; `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/true_holdout_generalization_summary.csv`

### Result 4: Continuous front-end bridge degrades under noise

Claim: The validation report marks continuous front-end degradation under perceptual noise as PASS.
Evidence: Validation report states low=1.0000 and high=0.3841; the full-model summary row at continuous_noise=1.0 has composition_accuracy_mean=0.3471.
Caveat: Preliminary bridge only; does not prove end-to-end perception.

## Thread-derived analysis

### Analysis source: `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`

Completed result / design / caveat / decision: Completed result with caveat.
Evidence: The thread analyzes Exp13 global/local capacity pressure, recurrence dissociation, consolidation retention asymmetry, adversarial context corruption, true primitive holdout, and continuous/noisy bridge.
Caveat: The same thread identifies major hardening needs: no-context-binding was not a pure ablation, holdout metrics were confusing, context corruption used a hard threshold, external baselines are missing, and consolidation needs dose-response.

## Key results (thread-integrated)

### Result 1: Global budget pressure creates an observed degradation curve

Claim: Under global memory pressure, Exp13 degrades below exact capacity and recovers at exact/surplus capacity.
Evidence: Local capacity summary for full model at 32 worlds and route length 12 rises from composition about 0.276 at budget 0.25 to 1.0 at budgets 1.0 and 1.25.
Caveat: Capacity-law fitting and confidence intervals remain required.

Source artifact: `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/capacity_pressure_summary.csv`; `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/plots/exp13_budget_breaking_curve_full_vs_consolidation.png`
Manuscript status: Promising

### Result 2: Local budget pressure appears to damage long-route execution more than global pressure

Claim: Local structural budget pressure appears more damaging to long-route composition than global pressure in the aggregate Exp13 summaries.
Evidence: At 32 worlds and route length 12, the docs-only comparison table reports local budget 0.75 route-table about 0.757 and composition about 0.138, while the matched global budget 0.75 row has composition about 0.758.
Caveat: The comparison table is aggregate-only; formal paired seed-level comparison and confidence intervals remain required.

Manuscript status: Preliminary

### Result 3: No-recurrence storage/execution dissociation replicates

Claim: Exp13 confirms recurrence is required for multi-step execution even when one-step route memory is intact.
Evidence: Local exact-capacity no-recurrence at 32 worlds and route length 12 has route-table accuracy 1.0 and composition about 0.0449.
Caveat: Symbolic benchmark; external recurrent baselines needed.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`
Source artifact: `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/capacity_pressure_summary.csv`
Manuscript status: Strong

### Result 4: Consolidation is a preliminary stability-plasticity bias

Claim: Exp13 suggests consolidation can bias which worlds survive under finite sequential capacity.
Evidence: Thread analysis cites retention heatmaps for full/consolidated versus no-consolidation at budget 0.5.
Caveat: Local validation reports only a small finite-pressure consolidation delta; dose-response is required.

Manuscript status: Preliminary

### Result 5: Context corruption has a hard selection threshold

Claim: Exp13 adversarial context corruption fails when wrong-world evidence dominates.
Evidence: Local context corruption summary shows composition/top-1 world accuracy 1.0 through positive world margins and collapse to about 0.032 composition with top-1 world 0.0 when the margin becomes negative.
Caveat: This is deterministic threshold-like corruption, not realistic stochastic noise.

Source artifact: `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/context_corruption_summary.csv`; `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/plots/exp13_context_adversarial_mixture_composition.png`
Manuscript status: Promising

### Result 6: Seen primitive composition and unseen primitive inference separate

Claim: Exp13 shows the model composes seen primitives but does not infer unseen primitive transitions.
Evidence: Local true-holdout summary shows one-step unseen primitive composition near chance while compositions from seen primitives remain high until severe holdout.
Caveat: Route-table all/seen/unseen metric split is required.

Source artifact: `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/true_holdout_generalization_summary.csv`; `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/plots/exp13_holdout_one_step_unseen_primitives.png`
Manuscript status: Needs metric cleanup

### Result 7: Continuous/noisy bridge is preliminary

Claim: Exp13 shows noisy continuous decoding can feed route memory, with downstream composition degrading as noise increases.
Evidence: Local continuous bridge summary shows full-model composition 1.0 at noise 0.0 and about 0.347 at noise 1.0.
Caveat: Not end-to-end perception.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`
Source artifact: `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/continuous_frontend_bridge_summary.csv`; `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/plots/exp13_continuous_frontend_decode_vs_noise.png`
Manuscript status: Preliminary

### Result 8: No structural plasticity remains near chance in capacity-pressure data

Claim: Exp13 capacity-pressure data include a no-structural-plasticity variant with near-chance route-table formation and composition.
Evidence: At 32 worlds and route length 12, `exp13_no_structural_plasticity` has route-table accuracy about 0.030 and composition about 0.035 across the reported budget ratios.
Caveat: This claim is supported by `capacity_pressure_summary.csv`; the Exp13 validation report does not mention no-structural-plasticity and should not be cited for this subclaim.

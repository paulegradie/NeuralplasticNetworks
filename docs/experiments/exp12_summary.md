## Purpose

Experiment 12 extends Experiment 11 from a successful context-separated memory demonstration into a paper-facing stress test. The experiment asks four questions: 1. **Capacity:** how many incompatible route worlds can the model retain? 2. **Continual retention:** after each new world is learned, do previous worlds remain accessible? 3. **Compositional generalization:** after training only one-step transitions, can recurrence execute held-out multi-step routes? 4. **Context robustness:** what happens when world context is noisy, blended, or partially dropped out? 5. **Consolidation pressure:** is consolidation actually useful under heavier capacity/noise pressure, or merely optional in the ea

## Key results

### Result 1: Full context-separated memory remains at ceiling through 32 worlds locally

Claim: The Exp12 final memory index reports full-model final composition and route-table accuracy of 1.0 at world_count=32.
Evidence: `exp12_full_context_separated_memory`, world_count=32: final_composition_accuracy=1.0, final_route_table_accuracy=1.0.
Caveat: Ceiling effects limit mechanism discrimination; Exp13 was designed to map breaking points.
Source path: `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/exp12_final_memory_index.csv`; `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/exp12_report.md`

### Result 2: No recurrence keeps route memory but loses multi-step execution at scale

Claim: The no-recurrence row at 32 worlds has route-table accuracy 1.0 but low composition accuracy.
Evidence: `exp12_no_recurrence`, world_count=32: final_route_table_accuracy=1.0, final_composition_accuracy=0.0566.
Caveat: Route-table/composition split is local to this benchmark family.
Source path: `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/exp12_final_memory_index.csv`

### Result 3: No structural plasticity and no world context degrade capacity summaries

Claim: At 32 worlds, no-structural-plasticity is near zero and no-world-context is far below the full model.
Evidence: `exp12_no_structural_plasticity`: final_composition_accuracy=0.0376; `exp12_no_world_context`: final_composition_accuracy=0.0706.
Caveat: No-world-context behavior varies with world count; avoid overstating complete failure.
Source path: `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/exp12_final_memory_index.csv`

### Result 4: Held-out multistep compositions remain at ceiling for full model in Exp12

Claim: The held-out generalization summary reports 1.0 composition accuracy for full model at 32 worlds and route length 12.
Evidence: `exp12_full_context_separated_memory`, world_count=32, route_length=12: composition_accuracy_mean=1.0, route_route_table_accuracy_mean=1.0.
Caveat: This uses seen primitive transitions; Exp13 separately tests primitive holdout.

## Thread-derived analysis

### Analysis source: `docs/threads/experiment11_export`

Completed result / design / caveat / decision: Design decision and validation smoke test.
Evidence: The thread designed Exp12 to test many-world capacity, continual retention, held-out composition, context bleed/dropout, and consolidation pressure; validation was explicitly only a smoke test.
Caveat: Do not treat the two-seed validation run as final evidence.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment11_export`
Related local artifact path: `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/HANDOFF.md`; `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12_validation/exp12_report.md`
Status: Design only

### Analysis source: `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`

Completed result / design / caveat / decision: Completed result with caveat.
Evidence: The thread says Exp12 full context-separated memory scales cleanly to 32 worlds; no-recurrence preserves route table but fails composition; no-structural-plasticity stays near chance; no-world-context declines as worlds accumulate.
Caveat: Context-bleed/dropout sweeps were considered too flat or inconclusive, and "generalization" should mean held-out multi-step execution over learned primitives.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`
Related local artifact path: `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/exp12_report.md`; `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/capacity_final_summary.csv`
Status: Strong

## Key results (thread-integrated)

### Result 1: Clean capacity scaling to 32 worlds

Claim: Exp12 full context-separated memory preserves perfect composition and route-table accuracy through 32 incompatible worlds under clean context.
Evidence: Capacity summary shows `exp12_full_context_separated_memory` composition and route-table accuracy 1.0 at world counts 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.
Caveat: Ceiling result; Exp13 is needed for breaking-point analysis.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`
Source artifact: `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/capacity_final_summary.csv`; `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/plots/exp12_capacity_composition_accuracy.png`
Manuscript status: Strong

### Result 2: No-recurrence reproduces the route-table/composition gap

Claim: Exp12 confirms that one-step route storage and multi-step execution dissociate.
Evidence: `exp12_no_recurrence` route-table accuracy remains 1.0 across world counts while composition stays around 0.05-0.06.
Caveat: Internal symbolic ablation; external baselines required.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`
Source artifact: `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/capacity_final_summary.csv`; `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/plots/exp12_route_table_composition_gap.png`
Manuscript status: Strong

### Result 3: No-world-context collapses as worlds accumulate

Claim: Exp12 supports world/context indexing as necessary for incompatible route-world retention under scaling.
Evidence: Thread reports no-world-context composition dropping from about 0.519 at 2 worlds to about 0.071 at 32 worlds; local capacity summary contains the same pattern.
Caveat: Needs external comparison to known context-gating methods.
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`
Source artifact: `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/capacity_final_summary.csv`
Manuscript status: Strong

### Result 4: Held-out composition is over learned primitives

Claim: Exp12 supports held-out multi-step execution over stored one-step transitions, not inference of unseen primitive transitions.
Evidence: The thread cites `heldout_generalization_summary.csv` and the heldout-by-length plot; local summary shows full model at ceiling for held-out multistep paths.
Caveat: The safer wording is "held-out compositional execution over learned one-step transitions."
Source thread: `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`
Source artifact: `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/heldout_generalization_summary.csv`; `experiments/experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/plots/exp12_heldout_generalization_by_length.png`
Manuscript status: Promising

## What this experiment supports (thread-integrated)

- Clean context scaling and continued route execution up to the tested world counts.
- Strong recurrence and structural-plasticity ablation story.

## What this experiment does not prove (thread-integrated)

- It does not establish a fitted capacity law because it is mostly at ceiling.
- It does not prove graded context-noise robustness.
- It does not prove unseen primitive inference.

## Follow-up actions (thread-integrated)

- Use Exp13 for boundary claims.
- Treat context-bleed/dropout artifacts as diagnostic until stochastic corruption is added.

# Project Status

## Current State

The repository contains thirteen completed top-level experiment directories plus a documentation scaffold under `docs/`. Thread digests from exported ChatGPT analysis have now been imported into experiment summaries, manuscript evidence documents, synthesis docs, and the thread index.

Source path: `docs/threads/THREAD_INDEX.md`; `docs/experiments/EXPERIMENT_REGISTRY.md`.

## Experiments Completed

- Exp1-Exp3: early MNIST/plastic-graph exploration; historical only for the route-memory manuscript.
- Exp4: first traversal-oriented successor task; route composition foundation.
- Exp5-Exp6: contextual successor attempts; caveated predecessors and route-audit correction.
- Exp7-Exp8: clean route-field diagnostic and self-organizing route acquisition.
- Exp9-Exp10: robustness, noisy/delayed feedback, adaptive reversal, and consolidation tradeoff.
- Exp11: context-separated incompatible-world memory.
- Exp12: clean capacity, continual retention, and held-out composition scaling.
- Exp13: finite-capacity breaking point, context corruption, holdout boundary, and continuous bridge.

Source path: `docs/experiments/EXPERIMENT_REGISTRY.md`.

## Main Scientific Findings So Far

Claim: Structural plasticity, world/context indexing, and recurrence form the current core mechanism.
Evidence: Exp8, Exp11, Exp12, and Exp13 ablations align with the thread digests and local summaries.
Caveat: Internal ablations only; external baselines are still missing.
Source path: `docs/manuscript/CLAIMS_AND_EVIDENCE.md`; `docs/threads/experiment12to13_export.md`.

Claim: Route-table storage and multi-step execution are separable.
Evidence: No-recurrence variants preserve route-table accuracy while composition fails in Exp11-Exp13.
Caveat: This is a route-memory benchmark claim, not a broad recurrence novelty claim.
Source path: `experiment11_context_memory/analysis/exp11/exp11_memory_indices.csv`; `experiment12_capacity_generalization/analysis/exp12/capacity_final_summary.csv`; `experiment13_breaking_point/analysis/capacity_pressure_summary.csv`.

Claim: Exp13 turns the story from ceiling performance into boundary mapping.
Evidence: Global/local budget pressure, adversarial context corruption, true primitive holdout, and continuous-noise bridge artifacts are present locally.
Caveat: Exp13 needs metric cleanup, true no-context-binding, stochastic context corruption, and consolidation dose-response.

## Current Manuscript Readiness

Status: promising but not submission-ready.

The strongest internal story is coherent, but the manuscript still needs external baselines, uncertainty reporting, final reproducible figure scripts, and Exp13.1 hardening before submission.

Source path: `docs/synthesis/PUBLICATION_READINESS.md`.

## Largest Blockers

- External baselines are missing.
- Exp13 holdout metrics require seen/unseen cleanup.
- Exp13 no-context-binding is not a clean ablation.
- Consolidation needs dose-response before becoming a central result.
- Context corruption needs stochastic/graded testing.
- Final figures need reproducible scripts and source-data tables.

## Recommended Next Action

Run the Exp13.1 publication-hardening audit as a new top-level experiment directory, then implement the minimum external baseline suite.

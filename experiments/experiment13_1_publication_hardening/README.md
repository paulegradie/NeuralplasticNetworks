# Experiment 13.1 — Publication-Hardening Route-Field Memory Audit

Experiment 13.1 is a successor protocol in the Context-Indexed Route Memory research program. It preserves the Experiment 13 breaking-point theme, but hardens the protocol for manuscript-readiness by separating controls that a reviewer could otherwise conflate.

The core question is:

> Is memory-like behavior in this system encoded partly in the plastic structure of recurrent route fields, rather than only in static learned weights or symbolic lookup tables?

This implementation is self-contained and table-based. It uses Python, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and the Python standard-library `sqlite3` module. It does not require PyTorch or dataset downloads.

## 1. Purpose

Experiment 13.1 is intended to cleanly audit whether route-field structure is doing mechanistic work. It separates:

- recurrence during evaluation from recurrence throughout the variant;
- route-table storage from composed traversal;
- live plasticity from previously formed structure;
- clean context from actually corrupted context;
- targeted route-field lesions from matched random lesions;
- local budget pressure from global budget pressure;
- no, weak, default, and aggressive consolidation.

The evidence discipline for interpreting results is:

```text
Claim -> Evidence -> Caveat -> Source path
```

## 2. Hypotheses

### Primary hypothesis

If memory-like behavior is partly encoded in plastic recurrent route-field structure, then disabling recurrence, freezing plasticity, corrupting context, or lesioning route-critical structure should produce specific, dissociable failures. In particular, local route-table accuracy may remain high while multi-step composition collapses, and targeted route-field lesions should impair performance more than matched random lesions.

### Secondary hypotheses

- Evaluation-only recurrence ablation should distinguish route storage from recurrent route execution.
- Recurrence-disabled-throughout should remain analytically distinct from eval-only recurrence ablation.
- Freeze-after-consolidation controls should preserve old-world structure while blocking adaptation to a new world.
- Context corruption should reduce world margin and increase context confusion before, or along with, composition failure.
- Local and global capacity limits should fail differently under consolidation pressure.

## 3. Design

The experiment generates incompatible transition worlds over a shared node/mode substrate. A route-memory model stores plastic route-field edges keyed by context slot, source node, mode slot, and target node.

The model explicitly guards the historical mode-slot bug from the Experiment 11/13 lineage:

- `mode_slot_count = modes + 1`;
- when `context_binding=False`, `_mode_slot()` returns the extra unbound slot `modes`;
- `_mode_slot()` raises an actionable `IndexError` if a slot is outside `[0, modes]`.

## 4. Variants

| Variant | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `exp13_1_full_model` | Main route-field memory model. |
| `exp13_1_no_recurrence_at_eval` | Keeps training/formation intact but disables recurrent traversal at evaluation. |
| `exp13_1_no_recurrence_throughout` | Represents recurrence-disabled-throughout separately from eval-only recurrence ablation. |
| `exp13_1_no_structural_plasticity` | Removes structural route updates. |
| `exp13_1_no_context_binding` | Collapses mode/context binding into the explicit unbound mode slot. |
| `exp13_1_no_world_gated_plasticity` | Removes the active-world plasticity advantage. |
| `exp13_1_no_consolidation` | Dose-response control with no consolidation. |
| `exp13_1_weak_consolidation` | Dose-response control with weak consolidation. |

- phase completed/total;
- elapsed seconds;
- unit rate;

- percent complete;
- detail strings such as seed, variant, corruption condition, or lesion condition.

## 9. Validation

The validator emits PASS/WARN/FAIL checks and writes:

```text
analysis/<run_id>/validation_report.md
analysis/<run_id>/validation_results.json
```

Validation checks include:

- required files and plots exist;
- `run_manifest.json` is loadable;
- SQLite exists and contains `metrics`, `metadata`, and `variants` tables;
- raw metrics are non-empty;
- required metadata and metric columns exist;
- metric columns are finite;
- bounded metrics lie in `[0, 1]`;
- required variants and phases are present;
- corrupted context conditions are present and not all identical to clean context;
- recurrence-ablation metadata distinguishes eval-only and throughout controls;
- lesion summaries include targeted and matched/random baselines;
- progress log includes ETA/rate fields;
- report includes caveats and avoids forbidden overclaiming phrases.

## 10. Known caveats

- This is an internal ablation harness, not an external baseline comparison.
- The table-based implementation is intentionally controlled; it is not a biological model by itself.
- Route-table accuracy is local transition knowledge and must not be interpreted as composed traversal.
- Smoke runs are only for artifact and sanity validation.
- Full profile results should still be interpreted with confidence intervals/effect sizes before manuscript use.
- Strong results would support the route-field memory interpretation only within this controlled task family.

## 11. How to interpret results

Use the report and CSVs to build claims conservatively:

```text
Claim:
Evidence:
Caveat:
Source path:
```

Examples of valid interpretations:

- A large route-table/composition gap in recurrence-disabled variants supports a storage/execution dissociation.
- A larger targeted-lesion sensitivity than random-lesion sensitivity supports route-critical structural dependence.
- Context corruption effects on world margin/context confusion support context-indexing vulnerability.

Avoid interpretations such as:

- claiming biological memory has been proven;
- treating internal ablations as external baselines;
- treating route-table accuracy as full composed reasoning;
- using smoke results as manuscript-grade evidence.

## 12. Repository integration after analysis

After a completed standard or full run has been analyzed, update:

- this README completed-runs/results section;
- `docs/experiments/exp13_1_summary.md`;
- `docs/experiments/EXPERIMENT_REGISTRY.md`;
- `docs/manuscript/CLAIMS_AND_EVIDENCE.md`;
- `docs/manuscript/FIGURE_PLAN.md`;
- `docs/manuscript/LIMITATIONS_AND_THREATS.md`;
- `docs/manuscript/MANUSCRIPT_TODO.md`;
- `docs/synthesis/PROJECT_STATUS.md`;
- `docs/synthesis/PUBLICATION_READINESS.md`;
- `docs/synthesis/NEXT_EXPERIMENTS.md`.

Do not mutate historical completed run artifacts.

## 13. GPU support

This experiment is table-based and currently CPU-oriented. It does not train neural networks and does not use PyTorch. GPU acceleration is therefore not used in the current implementation. This should be documented as a CPU-only limitation when importing results into synthesis/manuscript docs.

## 14. Completed runs and results

| Run ID | Profile | SQLite path | Analysis path | Validation | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `exp13_1_full_20260506_214756` | `full` | `experiments/experiment13_1_publication_hardening/runs/exp13_1_full_20260506_214756.sqlite3` | `experiments/experiment13_1_publication_hardening/analysis/exp13_1_full_20260506_214756/` | PASS 27, WARN 0, FAIL 0 | Full model solved clean composition across tested lengths; no-recurrence-at-eval kept route-table accuracy 1.0 but composition fell to about 0.0413 at route length 12; no-structural-plasticity fell to about 0.0307 composition; wrong-world injection collapsed composition at high corruption; local budget pressure was much more damaging than global budget pressure; targeted critical-edge lesions were less damaging than random count-matched lesions, so lesion evidence needs audit/rerun. |

Run configuration notes: full profile, seeds 0-19, world count 32 for variant comparison, route lengths 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16, budget world count 48, lesion world count 24, and context corruption levels 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, and 0.99. Source path: `experiments/experiment13_1_publication_hardening/analysis/exp13_1_full_20260506_214756/run_manifest.json`.

Key analysis outputs: `experiments/experiment13_1_publication_hardening/analysis/exp13_1_full_20260506_214756/exp13_1_variant_metrics.csv`; `experiments/experiment13_1_publication_hardening/analysis/exp13_1_full_20260506_214756/exp13_1_context_corruption.csv`; `experiments/experiment13_1_publication_hardening/analysis/exp13_1_full_20260506_214756/exp13_1_lesion_metrics.csv`; `experiments/experiment13_1_publication_hardening/analysis/exp13_1_full_20260506_214756/exp13_1_budget_consolidation.csv`; `experiments/experiment13_1_publication_hardening/analysis/exp13_1_full_20260506_214756/exp13_1_freeze_plasticity.csv`.

Import status: analyzed in `docs/threads/experiment13_1_analysis_digest.md` and summarized in `docs/experiments/exp13_1_summary.md`. The run is internal-ablation evidence only; external baselines, seed-level uncertainty, final figure scripts, and a lesion diagnostic audit remain required before manuscript promotion.
